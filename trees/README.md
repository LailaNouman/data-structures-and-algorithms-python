## Trees
A tree is a hierarchical data structure defined as a collection of nodes. Nodes represent value and nodes are 
connected by edges.

### Challenge
Create three classes (Node, Binary tree, Binary search tree) and implement methods in it.

## Approach & Efficiency
Time complexity: Big O(N)
Space complexity: Big O(N)

### API
We have 3 classes:
- Node: Initiate the value, right and left.
- BinaryTree: pre_order, in_order, and post_order methods.
- BinarySearchTree: add and contains methods.
