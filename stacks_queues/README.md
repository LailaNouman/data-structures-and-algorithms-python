## Stacks and Queues
Stack: First In Last Out.
Queue: First In First Out.

## Challenge:
Implement both stack and a queue using Node based data structure.

## Approach & Efficiency:
Time Complexity: Big O(1)
Space Complexity: Big O(1)


## API:
#### Stack:
- Push: Pushing element into the stack from the top.
- Pop: Removing the top element from the stack when you try to pop from an empty stack an exception will be raised.
- Peek: View the value of the top Node in the stack.
- Str: Convert the elements to string, for viewing the output of the stack.
- isEmpty: Returns true when stack is empty.
#### Queue:
- Enqueue: Inserting element into the queue.
- Dequeue: Removing the front element from the queue when you try to dequeue from an empty queue an exception will be raised.
- Peek: View the value of the front Node in the queue.
- Str: Convert the elements to string, for viewing the output of the queue.
- isEmpty: Returns true when queue is empty.
