# Singly Linked List

A singly linked list can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail). Each element in a linked list is called a node. A single node contains data and a pointer to the next node.

## Challenge:

Create a linked list class and include a head property and the class has methods like (insert, includes, toString) 

## Approach & Efficiency

The Big O Notation is O(1)

## API

- Insert: To insert values.
- Include: To check if a specific value exists in the list.
- toString: To print the list in a formatted way.
