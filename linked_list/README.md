# Singly Linked List

A singly linked list can be traversed in only one direction from head to the last node (tail). Each element in a linked list is called a node. A single node contains data and a pointer to the next node.

## Challenge:

Create a linked list class and include a head property and the class has methods like (insert, includes, toString) 

## Challenge 2:

append: adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
insert before: adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified
insert after: adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified

## Whiteboard


## Approach & Efficiency

append: Big O(N) | insert before: Big O(N) | insert after: Big O(N)


## API

- Insert: To insert values.
- Include: To check if a specific value exists in the list.
- toString: To print the list in a formatted way.
