### Challenge
Determine wheather the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both. Create a new tree with the same
structure as the original, if the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz” If the value is
divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz” If the value is divisible by 3 and 5 replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
if the value is not divisible by 3 or 5, simply return the number.
